## Step-by-Step Installation Guide

1. **Download the Project**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt
   - Run the following commands to download the project and navigate into its main folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Monoese/VoiceCordAI
   cd VoiceCordAI
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment for the Bot**
   - This keeps the bot's requirements separate from other Python projects
   
   **Windows:**
   - Create the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   py -m venv .venv
   ```
   - Activate it:
   ```bash
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
   ---
   
   **macOS/Linux:**
   - Create the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
   - Activate it:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   Note: When the environment is activated, you'll see `(.venv)` at the start of your command line

3. **Install Required Programs**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Your Bot Settings**
   - Create a new file named `.env` in the main folder
   - Open it with any text editor
   - Add these lines (replace with your actual tokens):
   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   ```

## Starting the Bot

1. **Launch the Bot**
   - Make sure you're in the project folder
   - Make sure your virtual environment is activated (you see `(.venv)`)
   - Run the bot using:
   
   **Windows:**
   ```bash
   py -m src.bot.main
   ```
   
   **macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   python -m src.bot.main
   ```

2. **Available Commands**
   - `/connect` - Joins your current voice channel, connects to the currently selected AI service, and prepares for voice interaction (standby mode).
   - `/set <service_provider>` - Sets the AI service provider to use. Options: `openai` or `gemini`. Example: `/set openai`
   - `/disconnect` - Leaves the voice channel, disconnects from the AI service, and resets the bot to an idle state.

3. **Voice Controls**
   After using `/connect`, the bot will send a message indicating the active AI provider. React to this message to control recording:
   - React with üéôÔ∏è to start recording your voice.
   - React with üéôÔ∏è again to stop recording and send your audio for processing.
   - React with ‚ùå to cancel the current recording without sending it.

## Need Help?
If you run into any issues, make sure:
1. Your virtual environment is activated (you should see `(.venv)` at the start of your command line).
2. All requirements are installed.
3. Your `.env` file contains valid tokens.
4. You're in the correct directory when running commands
