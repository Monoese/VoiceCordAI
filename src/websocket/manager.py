"""
WebSocket Manager module for handling WebSocket connections to external services.

This module provides the WebSocketManager class which:
- Establishes and maintains WebSocket connections
- Handles reconnection with exponential backoff on connection failures
- Sends events to the WebSocket server
- Receives and processes events from the WebSocket server
- Manages background tasks for sending and receiving data
- Implements a state machine to track connection status

The manager uses asyncio for asynchronous operation and provides a clean
interface for other components to send events without worrying about
the underlying connection details.
