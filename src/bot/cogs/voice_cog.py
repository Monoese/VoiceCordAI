"""
Voice Cog module for Discord bot voice interaction functionality.

This module provides the VoiceCog class which handles all voice-related commands and events:
- Connecting to voice channels
- Recording user audio
- Processing audio through WebSocket services
- Playing back audio responses
- Managing the bot's state during voice interactions

The cog uses reaction-based controls to start and stop recording, making it user-friendly
in Discord servers.
