"""
Bot state management module for tracking and controlling the Discord bot's state.

This module provides:
- A state enumeration (BotStateEnum) defining the possible states of the bot
- A state manager (BotState) that handles state transitions and permissions
- Methods for initializing, updating, and resetting the bot's state
- User authority tracking to control who can interact with the bot

The state system ensures the bot operates in a predictable manner and
prevents conflicting operations from occurring simultaneously.
